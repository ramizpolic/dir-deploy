# Directory Deployment

This repository contains the deployment manifests for AGNTCY Directory project.
It is designed to be used with Argo CD for GitOps-style continuous deployment.

The manifests are organized into two main sections:
- `projects/`: Contains Argo CD project definitions.
- `projectapps/`: Contains Argo CD application definitions.

The project will deploy the following components:
- `applications/dir` - AGNTCY Directory server with storage backend
- `applications/dir-admin` - AGNTCY Directory Admin CLI client
- `applications/spire*` - SPIRE stack for identity and federation

## Onboarding

To onboard a new environment to **Directory Public Staging Network**, check the
[onboarding guide](onboarding/README.md).

## Quick Start

This guide demonstrates how to set up AGNTCY Directory project using
Argo CD in Kubernetes Kind cluster.

1. Create Kind cluster:

   ```bash
   kind create cluster --name argo-dev
   ``` 

2. Install Argo CD in the cluster:

   ```bash
    kubectl create namespace argocd
    kubectl apply -n argocd -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/argoproj/argo-cd/stable/manifests/install.yaml
    ```

3. Deploy Directory via ArgoCD:

    ```bash
    # Add project
    kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ramizpolic/dir-deploy/main/projects/dir/project.yaml

    # Add application
    kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ramizpolic/dir-deploy/main/projectapps/dir/application.yaml
    ```


4. Check results in ArgoCD UI:

   ```bash
   # Retrieve password
   kubectl get secret argocd-initial-admin-secret -n argocd -o jsonpath="{.data.password}" | base64 -d; echo

   # Port forward the ArgoCD API to localhost:8080
   kubectl port-forward svc/argocd-server -n argocd 8080:443
   ```

   Login to the UI at [https://localhost:8080](https://localhost:8080) with username `admin` and the password retrieved above.

5. Clean up

   ```bash
   kind delete cluster --name argo-dev
   ```
